# Acknowledgments

We express our gratitude to all staff across the Vanuatu Public Service for participating in the Institutional Capacity Assessment (ICA) survey conducted in August 2025. Their insights have been crucial for comparing institutional capacities across ministries. We thank the PSC for supporting this initiative and the Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics (VBoS) for digitizing the `r year` ICA report, enabling automated data processing and analysis. This effort supports our commitment to strengthening public institutions in alignment with the NSDP.

## Ministries with Low Response Rates

The following departments had four or fewer responses to the Institutional Capacity Assessment (ICA) survey conducted in August 2025 and, therefore, have not been taken into consideration or have been filtered out from this report to ensure the reliability and representativeness of the analysis:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-low_response_departments

kable(low_response_departments, 
      booktabs = TRUE, 
      col.names = c("Ministry", "Department", "Number of Responses"),
      caption = "Departments with Four or Fewer Responses") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#006498", color = "white") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position", font_size = 8)

```

These departments were excluded from the comparative analysis and visualizations (e.g., heatmap, department rankings) to avoid skewed results due to insufficient data. Future assessments should aim to increase participation from these departments to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of institutional capacities across the Vanuatu Public Service.

# Introduction

The NSDP’s society pillar goal 6 aims for “strong and effective institutions for ensuring a dynamic public sector with good governance principles and strong institutions delivering the support and services expected by all citizens of Vanuatu.” The OPSC’s capacity assessment program is guided by this goal.

This report compares institutional capacities across all ministries in the Vanuatu Public Service, based on the ICA conducted in August 2025 with `r total_responses` staff responses. It identifies variations in capacity, highlights strongest and weakest areas by ministry, and provides recommendations to address gaps, ensuring alignment with the NSDP.

# Institutional Capacity Assessment Grid

## How Ministries’ Institutional Capacities Were Assessed

The OPSC’s Framework (Appendix A) focuses on organizational design, HRM, systems, leadership, and infrastructure. The ICAG aims to:

- Compare capacity areas across ministries.
- Track changes over time.
- Highlight differing views for discussion.

In August 2025, `r total_responses` staff across all ministries evaluated 31 capacity elements, scoring from 1 (Clear Need) to 4 (High). The ICAG provides an indicative measure to guide improvement.

```{r fig-five-steps-assessing-planning-capacity-development, fig.cap="Five-Step Process for Assessing and Planning Capacity Development Using the ICAG", fig.pos="H", out.width="500px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/five-steps-assessing-planning-capacity-development.png")
```

This report supports Step 3, comparing ministries to prioritize development.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The ICAG, digitized by VBoS using Microsoft Office 365 Forms, assessed 31 capacity categories. Staff scored from 1 (Clear Need) to 4 (High) based on descriptive statements. Responses were collected in a spreadsheet.

### Data Processing

VBoS performed:

1. **Data Extraction**: Exported responses to a spreadsheet.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Converted text responses to numeric scores (A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4). Missing responses were marked as missing.

### Data Analysis

VBoS used R to analyze data:

1. **Calculating Mean Scores**: Computed averages by ministry for each category using R[^1].
2. **Ranking Ministries**: Calculated overall capacity scores.
3. **Identifying Extremes**: Found strongest and weakest ministries and categories.
4. **Visualization**: Created heatmaps and bar plots to compare ministries.

[^1]: R is a free, open-source software used for statistical analysis, data processing, creating visualizations like graphs and tables, and automating this report’s generation.

### How the ICAG Scale and Analysis Methods Were Chosen

The ICAG scale (1–4) reflects Vanuatu’s public sector context. Mean scores were calculated from `r total_responses` responses. A threshold of ≤ 2 identifies urgent gaps, aligning with NSDP goals.

## Overview of Results

The Vanuatu Public Service faces resource constraints but is shifting toward collaboration with NGOs, CSOs, and FBOs. The August 2025 ICAG assessment compared ministries to identify capacity variations.

### Ministry Rankings

The following table ranks ministries by overall capacity score (average across all categories), based on `r sum(response_counts$Responses)` responses from `r nrow(response_counts)` ministries.

```{r tbl-ministry-rankings, results='asis'}
kable(overall_capacity, 
      booktabs = TRUE, 
      col.names = c("Ministry", "Overall Capacity Score"),
      caption = "Overall Capacity Scores by Ministry") %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#006498", color = "white") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position", font_size = 8) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "8cm")
```

### Comparative Capacity Across Ministries

The heatmap below compares the distribution of mean capacity scores across ministries, focusing on the top 5 strongest and top 5 weakest capacity categories based on overall performance in the August 2025 ICAG assessment. Each cell represents a ministry’s mean score for a category, with colors indicating Clear Need (≤1.5, dark red), Basic (>1.5–2.5, red), Moderate (>2.5–3.5, orange), and High (>3.5, green). Categories are ordered by their average score across ministries.

```{r comparative-capacity-table, fig.cap="Mean Capacity Scores Across Ministries for Top 5 Strongest and Weakest Categories", fig.pos="H", out.width="100%", fig.height=6}
# Prepare data: Identify top 5 strongest and weakest categories
category_ranks <- ministry_stats %>%
  group_by(Category) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Score = mean(Mean_Score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(Avg_Score)
weakest_categories <- head(category_ranks$Category, 5)
strongest_categories <- tail(category_ranks$Category, 5)
focus_categories <- c(weakest_categories, strongest_categories)

# Prepare table data: Pivot to have ministries as rows and categories as columns
table_data <- ministry_stats %>%
  filter(Category %in% focus_categories) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Category, values_from = Mean_Score) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 2)))

# Use heatmap_data (long format) for the heatmap
heatmap_data <- ministry_stats %>%
  filter(Category %in% focus_categories) %>%
  mutate(Category = factor(Category, levels = focus_categories))

# Create heatmap
ggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = Category, y = Ministry, fill = Mean_Score)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white", size = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("#8B0000", "#FF0000", "#FFA500", "#00FF00"),
                       values = scales::rescale(c(0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4)),
                       breaks = c(1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4),
                       labels = c("Clear Need", "Basic", "Moderate", "High"),
                       na.value = "white") +
  labs(x = "Capacity Category", y = "Ministry") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.caption = element_text(color = "#006498", face = "bold")) +
  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(barwidth = 10, barheight = 1))
```

The heatmap illustrates mean capacity scores across the top 5 weakest and top 5 strongest categories, identifying significant disparities among ministries. MJCS excels in "Strategic plan" (3.57, green), indicating robust planning processes, while MoET struggles with "Human resource development and training" (1.85, dark red), signaling a critical need for improvement. Overall, categories like "Access to suitable Administrative/Office support staff" and "Staff retention" frequently fall in the red-to-orange range (e.g., 2.0–2.76), suggesting widespread challenges in human resource support. Conversely, "Mission and Purpose" and "Strategic planning process" often score in the orange-to-green range (e.g., 3.07–3.44), reflecting relative strengths. PMO and MFAICET demonstrate consistent orange scores (2.33–3.22), indicating moderate to strong capacity, while MoH shows red scores (1.94–2.65), highlighting areas requiring urgent attention. This visualization, supported by detailed data in Appendix B (@tbl-appendix-b1 : Mean Capacity Scores by Ministry), underscores the need for targeted interventions, particularly in human resource development and infrastructure, to align with the NSDP’s goal of effective public institutions.
